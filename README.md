# Boxing Apps
Edit this document with your MicroBit boxing apps

There are devices available that can be used to track how well you exercise and therefore allow you to see how well you are progressing towards your exercise goals. 

The Gadget Show showed a small piece of tech that was clipped to a boxing glove so that it could measure how long you have been training for, how many strikes (or punches made in that time) and the force of an impact on the training pad. 
This data was sent to a smartphone so that the data could be analysed by an app, ready for display on the screen. 

Your task is to simulate this with the Micro:bit. Instead of displaying data on the phone - you will display on the Microbit display.
